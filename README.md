What I used in this React project? <br/>
I used only React Hooks and functional component.

<ul>
<li>useState</li>
<li>useEffect</li>
<li>useRef</li>
<li>fetch for get the data. You can use axios, It's up to you. But you have to install at the terminal like that "npm i axios" and import the component.</li>
</ul>
